## What if we want to investigate relationships between variables over time or space? {.smaller}

Time (and spatial) series are commonly *autocorrelated*:

-   the height of children is not independent on the height of the parents
-   the eustatic sea level in year *X + 1* is not independent on the sea level in year *X*

These are real-life processes that are the outcomes of many drivers, some random and some deterministic). But they can be represented (modeled) as *autoregressive processes*.

## Autoregressive processes

A process $X$ is an “autoregressive process of order *p*”, in short an *AR(p)* process, if:

$X_t = \alpha_1 X_{t-1} + ... + \alpha_p X_{t-p} + Z_t$

an event at time $t_i$ is remembered at a later time $t_{i+k} with a strength determined by the AR-coefficients $\alpha_k$, for *k = 1, 2,..., p*. No more memory effects of this event will be felt after $t_{i+p}$.

### The simplest autoregressive process AR(1)

$X_t = \beta + \alpha X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$

$\beta$ is the stable mean of the process

$\alpha$:
- Values close to 1 indicate that the series is almost like a random walk
- Values close to 0 indicate that the series is almost completely composed of random
normally-distributed error terms
- Other values are possible but won't be useful for us here

## Assumptions of regression analysis

1.  **The residuals are independent**

2.  Homoscedasticity

3.  The residuals of the model are normally distributed.

## Autocorrelation violates assumptions of regression analysis
