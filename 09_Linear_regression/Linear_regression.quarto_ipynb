        "The [Irish deer *Megaloceros giganteus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_elk), formerly called the Irish elk, is one of the iconic members of the Ice Age fauna. Now extinct, it reached some 2.1 m shoulder height and it massive antlers spanned up to 3.6 m. In modern deer, large antlers and scary display of them predict a high success among femals and thus a high reproductive success. This is an example of **sexual selection**, through which mating \"decorations\" or behaviors undergo positive selection, even though they may have no other use in one sex other than impressing its potential mating partners. This must have appealed to the Victorian prudery and the \"survival of the sexiest\".\n",

        "Linear regression is how you can tell whether this spicy explanation is correct, as has been done by the evolutinonary biologist Steven J. Gould (1974). He measured the shoulder heights and antler lengths of deer species of various sizes and showed that they fell on\n",
        "a line that describes the relationship. The antler length for the Irish elk was exactly as predicted based on this relationship for smaller deer. Indeed, the Irish deer survived for tens of thousands of years with its giant antlers and fared well until the end of the Pleistocene. Like many animals of the Pleistocene megafauna, its extinstion is attributed to climate change and hunting by early humans. \n",
